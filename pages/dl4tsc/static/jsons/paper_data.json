	"abstract": "<p>Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important task and can be seen in multiple domains ranging from the medical field to human action recognition. In 2019, a review by <a href\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10618-019-00619-1\">Ismail Fawaz et al.</a> for deep learning to solve this TSC problem was done. More recently, new state-of-the-art models such as InceptionTime have been proposed. All of the models are evaluated on the 128 datasets of the <a href=\"https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018/\"> UCR archive </a>. In this platform, we present all of the deep learning models for TSC evaluated on the UCR archive with four different visualization for their comparison. These comparison include a Critical Difference diagram, a Multi-Comparison Matrix, One-vs-One scatter plots and an efficiency comparison based on the number of parameters and FLOPS.</p>",
